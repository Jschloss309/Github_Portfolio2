Ruby Repl Game Called Showtime!

The game is about Conor McGregor vs Mayweather.
The game will ask a questions and provide some options.
Using the gets.chomp method it will collect some user input.
Using some Ruby flow control to output the result of those actions,
It will also include a fallback case for random input.
This game is cool.

Good Job with your Repl.
